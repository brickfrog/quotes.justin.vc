Risk analysts use micromorts to compare how dangerous different things are: scuba diving is 5 micromorts per dive;  COVID is 2,500 micromorts per infection; climbing Mt. Everest is 30,000 micromorts per attempt. So by analogy, micromarriages are a one in a million chance of getting married. Maybe going to a party gets you 500 micromarriages, and signing up for a really good dating site gives you 10,000. If there‚Äôs a Mt. Everest equivalent, I don‚Äôt know about it.</td>
