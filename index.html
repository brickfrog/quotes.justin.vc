      <td>Micromarriages come from this post by Chris Olah. They‚Äôre a riff on micromorts, a one-in-a-million chance of dying. Risk analysts use micromorts to compare how dangerous different things are: scuba diving is 5 micromorts per dive;  COVID is 2,500 micromorts per infection; climbing Mt. Everest is 30,000 micromorts per attempt. So by analogy, micromarriages are a one in a million chance of getting married. Maybe going to a party gets you 500 micromarriages, and signing up for a really good dating site gives you 10,000. If there‚Äôs a Mt. Everest equivalent, I don‚Äôt know about it.</td>

This doesn't mean that you can't have continuous integration or even continuous deployment.   Compared to this, trunk based development is easier - but it will not work when supporting multiple lines of product.  Use trunk-based development whenever possible - it's easier on multitude of levels. But, as EVERY SINGLE THING IN THE INDUSTRY it's not a silver bullet.</td>
