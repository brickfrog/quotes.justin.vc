She seems like a true citizen of the world, fascinated by all it has to offer, and freely admits she doesn't work for good people.The point of Joyce in the game is to throw you off the scent. If you're a leftist coming into a game like this, you automatically have some sympathy for the union and mistrust of the corporation. But Joyce is charismatic and helpful, while Evrart is antagonistic and seemingly corrupt. If you're not a leftist, you take them at face value.But this is a bait-and-switch. Evrart is only corrupt as a means to an end, and is secretly pursuing the far more moral and sympathetic goal: the economic freedom of Revachol from the Coalition. Joyce, meanwhile, is not a better person because she's aware she works for bad people. If anything, her awareness of it makes her worse. The way she describes "slumming it" in Martinaise as a youth also shows that while she might be worldly and hip, she's also fundamentally predatory towards these communities, taking what she wants from them and moving on. She has literally sold her soul to her corporate masters, as the Pale may very well have eradicated who she was and you have no idea how much of the persona she presents to you is accurate to who she is, or if there even really is one "Joyce."</td>

Risk analysts use micromorts to compare how dangerous different things are: scuba diving is 5 micromorts per dive;  COVID is 2,500 micromorts per infection; climbing Mt. Everest is 30,000 micromorts per attempt. So by analogy, micromarriages are a one in a million chance of getting married. Maybe going to a party gets you 500 micromarriages, and signing up for a really good dating site gives you 10,000. If there’s a Mt. Everest equivalent, I don’t know about it.</td>

      <td>We’re better at finding flaws in claims we don’t agree with than claims we do. It’s so easy to believe things that sound nice to us, even if they’re not true. It’s such a blatant cognitive bias. You don’t need to talk about availability heuristics or risk averseness or anything like that, it’s just “if you like something, you’ll be less diligent about evaluating it.”</td>
