Quotes and stuff I find randomly on the web / plan to integrate own thoughts and such, but now primarily using things extracted with https://quotebacks.net.

I -think- Quotebacks has stopped being updated, but the functionality still works well enough for me. 

Could this be done better in something like Notion? Probably, but, eh.

I'd maybe like to take a look at forking Quotebacks, but I'm... not great with JS.
